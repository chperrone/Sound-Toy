Interactive web audio api project

-----------------------
Introduction:

The goal of this project is to create a generative ambient music tool which people can use to compose their own ambient music soundscapes.  Generative music is music that allows variety and is created using guidelines and rules rather than rigid composition.


The idea for this project stemmed out of my desire to be able to listen to quiet, relaxing music while working or trying to fall asleep.  After researching and studying some of Brian Eno's work, I realized that the basic components of ambient and generative are very simple: create simple sets of rules that will generate interesting contrast, textures or harmonies.

Technologies:

This project employs the use of the Web Audio Javascript API which allows programmatic solutions to sample triggering, as well as a suite of audio effects.
